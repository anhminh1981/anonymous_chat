		<h2>The app</h2>
		<p>
			As usual, you can start the app from the <a href="#run" class="shortcut">Run</a> tab, and open it at
			<a href="http://localhost:9000" target="_blank">http://localhost:9000</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can enter some text and submit it, which should make it appear on the page. By opening it from another 
			browser, you can simulate another user.
		</p>
		
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>The controller</h2>
		<p>
			Let us take a look at the <a href="#code" class="shortcut">Code</a>, in particular that of 
			<a href="#code/app/controllers/Application.scala">Application.scala</a>.
			<pre>
				<code>
def ws = 
 WebSocket.tryAcceptWithActor[JsValue, JsValue] { 
	implicit request =>
    Future.successful(request.session.get(UID) match {
      case None => Left(Forbidden)
      case Some(uid) => Right(UserActor.props(uid))
    })
  }
		  	</code>
		  </pre>
		  	Here, the WebSocket.tryAcceptWithActor will instantiate a UserActor with the given Props and a 
		  	websocket that will send all messages from the client to the UserActor. It will also instantiate 
		  	another actor, and pass its reference to UserActor's constructor. Messages sent to that other 
		  	actor will then be forwarded via the websocket to the client side.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>The view</h2>
		<p>
			See <a href="#code/app/assets/javascripts/index.coffee">index.coffee</a>. Some javascript will 
			instantiate the client side of the websocket and consume messages from the server. Submission 
			from the #msgform form will be intercepted, and the content of the text input, converted to json,
			and sent up the websocket toward the server. 
		</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>The model</h2>
		<p>
			As said before, <a href="#code/app/actors/UserActor.scala">UserActor</a> serves as the gateway between the 
			actors and the websockets. It sends the messages to the <a href="#code/app/actors/BoardActor.scala">BoardActor</a>,
			which are then sent back to all instances of UserActor, and sent down the websocket to the clients.
		</p>
